Hello lieutenant,

You are controlling self-propelling underwater mine.

Use sliders to move the mine forward and backward, left and right.

The left button is sonar. Use it to locate enemy's submarine.

The right button is for mine activation. Use it when you are close to the target

You only have 3 pulses of sonar.

You cannot activate while sonar is working.


Now, please calibrate your control.

Move both sliders to the center, and press activate when you are ready.
