Hello lieutenant,

You are controlling self-propelling underwater mine.

Use sonar to locate enemy's submarine.

Use sliders to move the mine.

Activate the mine when you are in a close range to target.

You only have 3 chances of sonar.

You cannot move or activate while sonar is working.


Now, please calibrate your control.

Move both sliders to the center, and press activate when you are ready.
